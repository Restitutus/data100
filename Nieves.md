# Nieves et al. Response

Nieves et al. were attemping to use a random forest model in order to predict human population density and distribution. The random forest model functions by creating a series of weak tree learners, and then combines them into a stronger one. I do not know exactly what the benefit of this method is, but I would guess that it abides by either a) the law of large numbers, or b) the same principle which drives the efficacy of dynamic programming or GPU processing. In either case, I believe that the random forest model is demonstrating the "factorization" of software, as inefficient functional implementations are being replaced with highly-engineered dynamic implementations, which combine a series of components into an effective model. 

The random forest model is then used to generate a dasymetric map (one where unique colors or symbols are used to differentiate areas based on a variable), and urban areas proved to be the single strongest predictor of population distribution.
