Forrest et al. describe the Random Forest method for population mapping. They draw upon correlations between land cover features and population, plus national census data, and use these data to fit all of the people to their respective place. Their algorithm reads pixel input to generate regression "trees" in order to predict the population. However, this algorithm likely needs to be trained for each country, as different factors matter more in different countries. For example, Kenya's population is most predicted by distance from healthcare centers.

A machine-learning algorithm is an algorithm based around a loss function and which interprets inputs in accord to that loss function. Based on how its performances are rated by a controller, the algorithm will adjust its weights (the slope of a line running through vector space) and its biases (the displacement of the line running through vector space) until it correctly sorts the input and output. Machine learning has a heavy statistical element to it, and I would argue is just an automation of classical analysis methods. The primary difference is that a human can see unsorted data where a computer will try to force a pattern.
